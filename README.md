## Scrabble Solver

This provides a simple HTML textbox and button that allows the user to type in their seven Scrabble letters and get a list of possible words they can legally play with those tiles.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the project from GitHub.
2. Install Node.js if it is not already on your local machine.
3. Run startup.sh in your terminal to install express.js and start Node.js's built-in server running on your local machine. By default, you should be able to access this via your browser at http://localhost:8080/.
